# Key ponts related to temperature

1. **Temperature gradients in individual components should not be too large:**
   Temperature gradients produce gradients of thermal expansion, which in turn increase the internal friction within a component, thus increasing the
   thermal noise. In other words, when adjacent volumes of a component shrink or expand differently, they apply forces onto each other, producing
   dissipation and, therefore, thermal noise.  **For each component, we need to set the requirement as the maximum acceptable temperature gradient.
   This task requires calculating the final thermal noise contribution of each component. This would be a very challenging task for undergraduate
   students, therfore, Fabi√°n will do it.**
1. Once the temperature gradient requirements have been set, a parameter that must be calculated for each component is the minimum cross section that
   would allow enough heat extraction and yield a temperature gradient lower than the maximum allowed.
1. Given the minimum cross section for each component, we can go ahead and do the mechanical design with more confidence.
