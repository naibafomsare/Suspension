# Key ideas on how the cryogenic suspension works

1. Flexures in compression can be made thinner, i.e. softer and short i.e. good thermal conductivity, and allow mechanical assembly with braze without introducing additional thermal noise
1. Fat suspension beams allow for longer pendulum with good thermal conductivity.
1. Using counterweights the suspension beams become inertially massless for horizontal attenuation (data from Fabian)
1. Resonances can be damped by means of optic sensors and electrostatic actuator in feedback.
1. Mirror control for lock acquisition and maintain can be done from the counterweight thus eliminating the recoil mass
1. Esra's blades are needed to equalize stress on the four suspension beams.
1. Tensional stress on the top surface limits the stress in the blades and they are stiff (give k)
1. Stiff blades are not suitable for attenuation of suspension thermal noise from upper levels, which would be dominant, therefore	the blade springs can be soft by means of optic sensors and electrostatic actuator in feedback (give range estimations).
