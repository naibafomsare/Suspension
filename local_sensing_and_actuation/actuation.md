The goal of the exercise is to calculate the actuation requirements of the suspension in order to allow the lock acquisition of the main interferometer.

The steps to follow are:

1. Fabi√°n should ask KAGRA people the distance the mirror needs to be moved in order to allow the lock acquisition.
   This shoud be a length expressed as a factor of the wavelength $\lambda$.
